This seems reasonable—you want to isolate HDL's \"independent\" effect.\n\nBut here's the problem: total cholesterol roughly equals LDL plus HDL. When you adjust for total cholesterol, you're implicitly comparing people with the same total but different compositions.\n\nImagine two people with identical total cholesterol. If one has higher HDL, they must have lower LDL. So you're really comparing someone with high HDL and low LDL to someone with low HDL and high LDL—and attributing the entire difference to HDL.\n\nStudies that avoided this adjustment found much weaker HDL associations. The apparent HDL benefit was at least partly an artifact of how the data were analyzed.",

Meanwhile, people with LDL-lowering variants have dramatically fewer heart attacks—exactly as predicted if LDL is causal.\n\nThe verdict was becoming clear: HDL was a marker of metabolic health, not a lever you could pull.

Moving the number wouldn't move the outcome.\n\nSecond, even if HDL had been causal, drugs affect the body through multiple pathways. Torcetrapib raised blood pressure through mechanisms that had nothing to do with HDL. Any drug brings its own biology, and that biology can work against you through pathways you're not watching.\n\nThe evidence to identify both problems existed before billions were spent on trials.
